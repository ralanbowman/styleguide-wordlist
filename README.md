# Style Guide and Word List

As the lone technical writer at a previous employer, I was on my own when it came to choosing tools and setting standards. In order to keep things consistent, I created a style guide and word list. Not wanting to reinvent the wheel, I borrowed heavily from the [O’Reilly Stylesheet and Word List](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000969/index.html “O’Reilly Stylesheet and Word List”), and because I knew through user research that the vast majority of our customers were using Windows systems, the [Microsoft Manual of Style](https://www.microsoftpressstore.com/store/microsoft-manual-of-style-9780735648715 “MMoS v4”). 

Starting with this foundation, I created an in-house style guide and word list that could be used by anyone in the company to make sure that any content we created: user guides, release notes, support ticket replies, website copy, JIRA issues, or Confluence pages, all had a consistent style and look.
